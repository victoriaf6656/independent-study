# Entry One: Introduction

There were many topics to choose for my independent study. For independent study,
we have nine weeks to do this. I like working with CSS and HTML, including Bootstrap. I would like to continue what I'm doing.
According to Mr.Mueller, there are three parts of choosing topics for independent study. Something that you can enjoy doing, something that seems doable, and
something that would help me expand my horizons. In the end, I chose EarSketch. When I watched the demo, I felt like I 
understood it briefly. I was curious on how to continue or change the beats/sounds. I liked listening to music,
so I wanted to code music with my own time from scratch.
### What is EarSketch?

[Earsketch](http://earsketch.gatech.edu/landing/#) is a free educational programming environment. Its' purpose is to make
music with code. It uses Python and Javascript. Python is a back-end programming language. Javascript is a programming
language of HTML and the Web. EarSketch is an authentic, STEAM-Based Approach to Computing Education, to broaden in participation
in Computing and Music.

#### Takeaways

<br>
#### Next Steps
1. What I learned this past week wasn't enough, so I hope to discover more of EarSketch to decide what to do for independent study.
I would like to be patient to know what to do.
2. I need to study more of Python and Java in EarSketch...I forgot what I learned from Freshman year.
3. I need to make this entry longer...
4. From Mr.Mueller: Learn and Build!!! 

**I will update later on...** <br>
