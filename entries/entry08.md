# Entry Eight: The Lyrics of a Song
Since the Expo, I have been thinking how to make my project better. This past week, I have been thinking about the lyrics that I'm going to use for my song. I have decided to use a modern singing synthesizer, **Vocaloid** to input the lyrics. I have been watching the demo of how to use it.

#### Lyrics Making
- Lyrics are hard to make up to the song. To make the lyrics synchronized with the song, I had to make few changes to my EarSketch project. In EarSketch, I had to make the song longer and add a few audio clips to make it sound better.

I have been listening to music in all of my life, like sad melodies, love stories, and Disney. Research was easy. I knew what kind of lyrics to add, but the arrangement of the lyrics and the song is hard. So I decided to use a modern singing synthesizer to help me.

+ This video was interesting and it takes time to learn all the parts to lyrics making in **Vocaloid**. To sum it up, I just need to use a voicebank, add lyrics, adjust the tone and tempo; and like that is the end.

#### Takeaways
1. Do what you need to know. To learn what you need, you should do it and show yourself in the process of your independent study project.
