# Entry Five: Usage of EarSketch's Resources
This past week, I was trying to figure out the missing part of the music. I needed to find some sounds
or audio clips to connect with each other. To make it resonate, I decided to make use of my resources.

#### Introduction to Freesound.org
The list of sounds in EarSketch is from Freesound.org. With Freesound.org integration, EarSketch users
can import sounds from Freesound.org into their EarSketch DAW, without having much trouble.

To get access to the sounds in Freesound.org and importing them to EarSketch, you have to register for a
Freesound account. You can then download the song and import them into your EarSketch DAW.

#### Recording and Uploading Songs
In EarSketch, there is a list of sounds on the left. There, you can see the tab, **+ Add your own sound**.
Click on the tab and follow the directions.

+ **Recording Sounds**
    + Press allow to use the microphone
    + Click on **Quick Record**
    + Record Sound
+ **Uploading Sounds**
    + Click on the small tab on the left labled, **Upload New Sound**
    + Click on **Choose a file** and choose the file that you downloaded
    + Then just search up the file's name in the search browser and iport the sound onto your EarSketch DAW
        + Example: ```fitMedia(VICTORIAF6656_SACK_CHASER_MP3,2,1,20)```
+ **Using Freesound**
    + As you click on the tab labled **Freesound**, you can search for a sound query in the text search box.
        + Example: ![Freesound Search Query](search_sound_query.png)
