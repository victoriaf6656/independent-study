# Entry Six: Useless Information?
This past week, I finished tidying up the song. So, I went back to EarSketch to see some more learning to do.
But these information are probably won't be used for some time.

**Notes**
+ **Sonification**- (Image as Data) A digital image is made up of small pieces of data and sonification let us turn data into sound.
The data are called pixels, which have numbers as data.
+ **Importing Images**- In EarSketch, you can import image to convert them into data. The code is ```importImage```, which
takes three (3) arguments.
+ ```importImage(imageURL, numberOfRows, numberOfColumns)```
+ The number of rows and columns refer to the size of the image.
Example: ```myImage = importImage("http://earsketch.gatech.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/grid_zoomed.png", 8, 8)```
+ A **multi-dimensonal list** combines multiple lists.
+ A two dimension, multi-dimensional list can be thought of as table with x and y values.
+ **Nested loops**  are loops within a loop, that can be used to sort through multi-dimensional data.


#### Takeaways
1. Remember to find out which data are useless into learning or not.
