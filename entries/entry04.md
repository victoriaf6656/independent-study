# Entry Four: Four Weeks of Learning
Continuing from the last entry, I learned some key terms that I forgot and other parts of EarSketch. Though I was on
vacation for another week, I still feel tired and forgot to push this entry.

#### Key Terms
+ **Substring** - A partial string that occurs inside of a larger string.
    + ```myString[startIndex,endIndex``` - Assigning the index values of stringA to newString
+ **Concatenation**- A link string together to form a new string, using the **+** symbol in Python.
(Though I used this back then, I didn't hear of this key term yet...)
    + Example: ```x=beatstring1 + beatstring2```

#### Advanced Transition Techniques
1. **Snare Roll**- A sequence of repeated snare hits, increasing density, pitch, or amplitude. This is like using 
a for-loop or ```makeBeat()```
2. **Looping**- Repeating a short segment pf melody before a new section
3. **Contrast**- Refers to differences in neighboring sections of music, which provides balance with repetition.
4. An **Anacrusis** is a series of notes that lead into the first set of melody.
5. ```insertMediaSection()```- Allows partial segments of a sound clip to be inserted into the DAW. It takes five arguments:
    + **File Name**-The sound clip being used
    + **Track Number**- The track on which the music is placed.
    + **Measure Number**- The starting measure of the clip
    + **Start Location**- Starting location withing the clip
    + **End Location** - End location withing the clip
```insertMediaSection(DUBSTEP_BASS_WOBBLE_008, 5, 8, 4, 5) # placing the last measure (4 beats) of this clip```

#### Understanding EarSketch
In this section, there are parts of the tutorial to understanding EarSketch, like how to debug and how to fix them. For example, 
it showed that the ```print``` statement evaluates the argument and helps you to debug. I don't think there is a need to
list them...

#### Next Steps
1. Don't Procasinate!!!

#### Takeaways
1. Continue to tinker to understand the syntax in what you you are learning. Tinker by changing the values of the code...
