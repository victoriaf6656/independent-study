# Entry Seven: Getting Ready for the MVP
This past week, I finished tidying up the song. Now, I plan to add lyrics to the song itself. To be able to synchonize
lyrics and the song togther, I need to search up a vocal synthesizer, which enables to use others' voices to sing the 
lyrics out.

##### Vocal Synthesizer Options:
***Source: https://alternativeto.net/software/vocaloid-3/***
+ **Vocaloid**- The modern singing synthesizer, which has 4 voicebanks (Japanese/English), over 1000 vocal phrases and
over 1000 audio samples. You can use the singing voice quickly and customize your own vocal.
+ **UTAU or Vocal Synthesizer Tool**- UTAU is a voice-synthesis software developed by Ameya/Ayame and made for the Windows operating system.

I rememberd the time when I listened to music while seeing the video of lights that corresponded or synchronized with the
song itself. This past week, I was looking into what I was searching for to be the MVP to show for the Expo. After
searching up on Google and describing it, I found the answer for my MVP. It is an **Audio Visualization**.

#### What is Audio Visualization?
**Music Visualizer**: A feature that generates animated imagery based on a piece of music. *"This imagery is unusually generated and rendered in real time and in a way 
synchonized with the music it is played"*, according to ***Wikipedia***.

+ Here is an example of a Music Visualization:
    + ![M-Visualization]()
+ For the Audion Visualization, I plan to use a website demo to try it out instead of coding it because of less time before the Expo.
#### Takeaways
1. Don't stress out for the upcoming Expo!
2. Take away as much information as you can get out off from Google Searching.
